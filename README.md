This repo is just to test the possibility for GitHub actions to be able to push to the repository. Based on https://lannonbr.com/blog/2019-12-09-git-commit-in-actions this seems to be possible.

This really does seem to work.

Now the second test is to be able to see if we are able to push to master, even though the original commit is on develop.

Getting the SHA of the most recent commit makes sense of course, because a single push can push multiple commits.
